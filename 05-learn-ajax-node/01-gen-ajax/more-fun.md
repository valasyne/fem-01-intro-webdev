# More Fun

1. Add to GH in own repo.
2. Style nice using CSS.
3. Show a loading GIF (just something like `<img />` that shows it's loading), then hide it when done.
4. With dog.ceo, request a [list of breeds](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).
5. Use the list to populate a `<select>`.
6. Then when the user chooses a dog breed, show a picture of that dog using the API's [random image by breed](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed).
